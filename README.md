**Symbol Converter** is a lightweight desktop app made specifically for creating **stylish BattleTags** that stay within **Blizzard’s naming restrictions**.

## ⚔️ Why Use This for BattleTags?

Blizzard restricts BattleTags to:

* ✅ Letters and numbers only (no special characters like `!@#`).
* ✅ 3–12 characters in total.
* ✅ Cannot start with a number.

All symbol variants in this tool are valid **Unicode alternatives** of standard characters — making them **100% acceptable** by Blizzard's system but still **visually unique**.
